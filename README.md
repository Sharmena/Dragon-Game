# Dragon-Game

Welcome to The Tomb of the Dragon Child!

You are an artifact collector searching for the Tomb of the Dragon Child.
Upon entering a location that you suspect is the tomb, you are emmersed in a green smoke that causes you to be knocked unconscience. 
When you wake up, you find that your clothes are now scales and you have been turned into a dragon child! 
You belongings seem to have dissapeared but you have a set of items that appear when you think about them. 
Now you must figure out how to get out of this place and turn back into a human so that you can return to your regular life.

You get a feeling that if you can make it thorugh all the rooms, then you can drink a vial and become human once again.

Here is the list of commands that you can use*:

Commands: This will show you this list as a reminder of what you can do in each room
Left, Right, Forward: This will help you navigate each room
Inventory: This will tell you waht you have with you
Look: This will help you see what is in a rom with you
Hint: This might help you solve the puzzle in each room
Use __: This will use an item in you inventory or in the room. What you use can change based on where you are and what you have

Other commands will be introduced throughout the game. Some will help. Some will not

*Note that this game is not caps sensitive and the result of LOOK is the same as LoOk and look
